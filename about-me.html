		<p id="title">About me...<br></p>

		<p class="quotes">"I would love to change the world, but they won't give me the source code"</p>
		<p>
		I'm just the regular guy next door. Unfortunately, I don't have a grown grey beard.. yet.<br>
		I do believe the end is near and all the planets are aligned; no other reason would explain you reading this.<br>
		Been speaking C for years and done somewhat nice stuff with it; I'm also fluent in Java and Latin.<br>
		I'm a proud owner of a beautiful sounding and punch-deliverer K24A3 i-VTEC engine and as you may guess, I love my nipponic precious.<br>
		Music keeps me sane. I tend to see the world as a big engineering problem which I can only forget when I'm listening or playing.<br>
		Besides that, I can't cook more than some grilled meat on the famous barbeques - the best - held in Quinta da Moura.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
		This whole webpage was built using nothing more than Free Software.<br>
		Don't ever try to argue with me about my awesome Debian Sid. I advice you to neither do it without being able to suffer the consequences.<br>
		</p>
		<p>Finally, props to my dear friend sanchaz, who hosts this page at no charge. Thanks.</p>
